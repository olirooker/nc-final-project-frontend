                    1. Safety in numbers Always stay within a group when
                    possible. By remaining close to the people you trust and
                    know well, you’ll reduce the risk of being targeted by
                    people who are up to no good and could be out to take
                    advantage.

                    2. Get taxis or arrange a lift When traveling at night
                    always book a taxi or get a lift with someone you trust.
                    It’s worth that little extra expense to take a ride in a cab
                    and get home safely. If travelling by bus it’s best to sit
                    on the lower deck as this is closer to the exit and within
                    sight of the bus driver should there be a problem.

                    3. Always book your taxi When you book a licensed mini-cab
                    or taxi you know it is reputable and reliable. Black cabs
                    are the only type of private hire that you can hail on the
                    street unlike all other cabs which must be pre-booked via
                    phone or app. Don’t be tempted to get into an unlicensed cab
                    for a quicker ride home. The risks, especially to
                    unaccompanied women, are far too high.

                    4. Drink in moderation & watch your drink Always stay in
                    control when drinking alcohol. Know your limits and never
                    push them. A few more drinks may seem like fun at the time,
                    but it is never a good idea. Keep a close eye on your drinks
                    and never leave them unattended at any point. Having your
                    drink spiked – perhaps whilst you momentarily turn your back
                    - will ruin your night and maybe your life.

                    5. Stay in well-lit areas If walking home after a night out,
                    always stay in well-lit areas where there are plenty of
                    people. People are less likely to commit crime if there is
                    good lighting, CCTV and people around to see what is
                    happening. Always plan a route home and make sure you stick
                    to places you know. Never take short cuts, especially down
                    dark allies, by canals or through unlit parks.

                    6. Keep valuables hidden Don’t advertise your mobile phone
                    to people on the street - keep them hidden. People will
                    often have valuables stolen on a night out and if you’re
                    drunk, you are an easier target. Keep all valuables like
                    phones, wallets and purses in zipped pockets or bags.
                    Ideally, leave valuables such as jewellery at home, but if
                    you must take them out with you then keep them safely
                    hidden.
                </p>

                    7. Keep away from hostile situations Don’t be a hero on a
                    night out. If there is a fight or an argument stay out of it
                    and get help from bouncers or the police.
